# ![Yeti-logo](doc/yeti.png): a Yorick extension

[[News](./NEWS.md)] [[License](./LICENSE.md)]

Yeti is an extension of Yorick (a fast interpreted interactive data processing
language written by David Munro) which implements (see "*Quick Reference*" below
for a list of additional functions):
 * hash table objects
 * regular expressions
 * complex, real-complex and complex-real FFT by FFTW (the Fastest Fourier
   Transform in the West -- version 2)
 * wavelet filtering ("*à trou*" method)
 * fast convolution along a chosen dimension with various border conditions
 * more string functions
 * memory hacking routines
 * more math functions (sinc, round, arc)
 * generalized matrix-vector multiplication (with possibly sparse matrix)
 * routines to query/check Yorick's symbols
 * support for reading TIFF images
 * morpho-math operators
 * ...

This distribution of Yeti may come with several extensions (depending
whether corresponding directories exist or not):
 * `fftw` ..... support for FFTW
 * `regex` .... support for POSIX regular expressions
 * `tiff` ..... support for reading TIFF images


## Compilation and Installation

Starting with version 6.0.0, Yeti is built as a regular Yorick plugin and some
of the Yeti extensions are built as standalone Yorick plugins (they do not
require Yeti to be used). The installation of Yeti depends on that of Yorick
which must have been installed prior to Yeti. You'll need at least version 2.2
of Yorick (for Yorick version 1.5, you can install Yeti 5.3 and for Yorick 1.6
to 2.1 you can install Yeti 6.2).

The first installation step consists in the configuration of Yeti software
suite.  This is done via the "configure" script (1).  In order to figure out
the different options (and their default values), you can just do:

```.sh
./configure --help
```

At least version 2.2 of Yorick is required to configure/build this version of
Yeti.

By default, the script tries to find an axecutable named "yorick" in your path
(according to your environment variable PATH).  You can however specify a
different Yorick executable with option:

```.sh
./configure [...] --yorick=PATH_TO_YORICK_EXECUTABLE [...]
```

with `PATH_TO_YORICK_EXECUTABLE` the full path to Yorick executable.

If you want Yeti plugin for extended regular support, you'll have the choice
to use a system provided POSIX REGEX library or the GNU REGEX library which
can be built into the plugin. This is achieved by defining the preprocessor
macro `HAVE_REGEX` to true if you trust your system REGEX library.  To use the
POSIX REGEX library of your system:

```.sh
./configure [...] --with-regex-defs='-DHAVE_REGEX=1' [...]
```

and to build the GNU REGEX library into the plugin (this is the default
behaviour):

```.sh
./configure [...] --with-regex-defs='-DHAVE_REGEX=0' [...]
```

For instance, here is how to call the configure script to use builtin REGEX
support and to enable plugins for FFTW (installed in /usr/local) and TIFF
(installed in standard locations):

```.sh
./configure --with-regex \
    --with-fftw --with-fftw-defs="-I/usr/local/include" \
    --with-fftw-libs="-L/usr/local/lib -lrfftw -lfftw" \
    --with-tiff --with-tiff-libs="-ltiff"
```

In order to check your configuration settings, you can add `--help` as the
last argument of the call to `./configure`.

After configuration, you can build Yeti and all related plugins by just doing:

```.sh
make
```

In order to install Yeti files into Yorick installation directories,
you simply do:

```.sh
make install
make install-doc
```
