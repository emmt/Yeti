NOTATIONS
---------
[ ] means "to do"
[-] means "abandoned" (i.e. it was a bad idea or found another way to solve
    for that)
[+] means "done"


YETI
----
[ ] use GIT instead of RCS;
[ ] autoload yhd_save, yhd_restore, etc.;
[ ] add support for sparse matrix in YHD files;
[ ] make a h_save and h_restore functions:
    h_save, tab, var1, var2, ...; // saves variables as members of tab
    same as: h_set, tab, var1=var1, var2=var2, ...;
    tab = h_save(var1, var2, ...); // creates new hash-table with members
    same as: tab = h_new(var1=var1, var2=var2, ...);
    h_restore, tab; // restore all members in current context
    h_restore, tab, var1, var2, ...; // restore some members
[-] make Yeti 'relocatable' like Yorick (now Yeti is a regular plugin of
    Yorick)
[ ] write a widget/plotter server (with Tcl/Tk or Gtk)
[+] make Yeti as a plugin for Yorick 1.6
[+] implement (re)loadable plugins
[ ] use Yeti stack managed workspace in yeti_regex.c
[ ] give up compatibility with Yorick-1.4
[ ] cleanup yeti_strcpy, yeti_strncpy in yeti_utils.c -- provide a p_strncpy
    which is missing in Yorick's Play library, in fact:
    #define p_strncpy(s,n) p_strncat((char *)0, (s), (n))
    would do the trick
[ ] implement binary data conversion in yeti_channel.c


INTERNALS OF YORICK
-------------------
[-] Modify FreeBIFunction() in ydata.c so that freeing builtin function
    becomes impossible.
[-] Patch the list object code to avoid loop in references.
[-] Have some mean to avoid warning messages when freeing builtin functions
    (which sucks when a plugin get reloaded).


HASH OBJECTS
------------
[ ] h_cpy() to effectively duplicate a hash table object.
[ ] There is maybe a possibility to extend the cases where member
    assignation is allowed (OBJ.MEMBER = VALUE should behave as
    h_set, OBJ, MEMBER=VALUE).
[ ] cleanup hash-table code (remove/change h_copy/h_clone functions
    and make the 'ydf' format available in yeti_hash.i)
[ ] no needs(?) for 'ReplaceRef' in hash table code


INTERFACE TO YORICK INTERNALS
-----------------------------
[ ] remove suffix _base in all yeti_push_new..._base and remove
    corresponding macros that return a DataBlock (if you really want the
    address of the new DataBlock you can just take the value of the topmost
    stack synbol)
